# NativeScript Nova

A simple, clean and extendable theme for NativeScript. Built on Sass. Swap out the colors in the colors.scss file to get an entirely new theme.

[See The Screenshots](https://goo.gl/photos/y3RNGLTHsv6GrjEp7)

Just grab the app.css file from the app/build directory and slap it in the app folder of your own project. Docs coming soon.
